The box of a boxplot visualizes the median, first quartile, and third quartile of a dataset.
The length of the box in a boxplot visualizes the interquartile range.
The whiskers extend from the box 1.5 times the size of the interquartile range.
Outliers are points that fall outside of the whiskers. Theyâ€™re represented by dots.
Boxplots are especially useful for comparing the spread of multiple datasets.
